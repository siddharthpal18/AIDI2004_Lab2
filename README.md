1. Importing Libraries:

numpy and pandas for data manipulation.
matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for data visualization.
train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing for standardizing feature values.
RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble for building a random forest classification model.
Various metrics from sklearn.metrics for evaluating the model performance.
Loading the Dataset:

Reads the breast cancer dataset from a specified file path using Pandas.


2.  Data Preprocessing:

Renames the columns of the DataFrame for better readability.
Replaces the diagnosis labels 'M' (Malignant) with 0 and 'B' (Benign) with 1.
Drops the 'ID' column as it is not used for modeling.
Calculates the correlation matrix and visualizes it using a heatmap.
Data Splitting:

Splits the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).
Splits the data into training and testing sets using a 70-30 split ratio.
Feature Scaling:

Standardizes the feature values using StandardScaler to ensure all features have the same scale.
Random Forest Model Training:

Initializes a RandomForestClassifier.
Fits the model on the training data.
Model Prediction and Evaluation:

Predicts the target variable on the test set.
Calculates and prints the accuracy of the model using the accuracy_score function.
Prints the predicted values on the test set.
